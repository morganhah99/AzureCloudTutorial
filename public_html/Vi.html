	<h2>Vi Tutorial</h2>
	<h3>Introduction:</h3>
	<p>Vi is a visal text editor included by default on Unix operating systems.<br>
	It is a character-based screen editor without a GUI. One of vi's major draws<br>
	is its ubiquity and accessibility. You don't need a desktop enviornment to use it,<br>
	and it is typically already installed on your system.<br>
	vi gives users a robust editing experience without ever having to leave the keyboard's<br>
	home row. With a dedicated command mode, vi utilizes the full keyboard for tasks<br>
	like navigating a file, manipulating text, searching, and replacing phrases</p>
	<h3>How to open vi editor</h3>
	<p>You can open up vi with the vi command. Generally, if your system uses vim, this command still links<br>
	to it, but you can also use the vim command in that case. You could alternatively, openvvi with a file<br>
	using the vi [example-file.txt], replace example-file with the path to the desired file
	</p>
	<h3>vi modes</h3>
	<p>vi has two distinct modes, getting familiar with them helps you get the most out of vi</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Normal mode: This mode is also known as "command mode" and is the mode where you enter<br>
		most of your vi commands. Key pressed in normal mode are evaluated as commands and not as text<br>
		entered on the file you are editing.</li>
		<li>Insert mode: This mode is your main place for entering text. Here, your key presses tend to<br>
		operate how you would expect in a text editor. You can enter this mode by pressing the i key<br>
		while you are in normal mode. Alternatively, you can press the o key to insert a new line<br>
		and immediately enter Insert mode.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Common vi commands in normal mode</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Opens a file in the current user's home directory</li>
		<pre class="command">:e ~/example-file</pre>
		<li>Writes changes to a file, if you want to specify the file to save to,
			add the path after the command</li>
		<pre class="command">:w ~/example-file</pre>
	</ul>
	<h3>Navigation</h3>
	<p>You can navigate text in vi using the arrow keys, whether in normal or insert mode. However, in<br>
	normal mode, you can also use the keys in the list below. Some of these keys help keep you from<br>
	laving the home row for the arrow keys, but most add handy and efficient navigation shortcuts</p>
	<ul>
		<li>j</li>
		<pre class="command">Moves the Cursor down a line</pre>
		<li>k</li>
		<pre class="command">Moves the Cursor up a line</pre>
		<li>h</li>
		<pre class="command">Moves the Cursor to the left one character position</pre>
		<li>l</li>
		<pre class="command">Moves the Cursor to the right one character position</pre>
	</ul>
	<h3>Undo and Redo</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>u</li>
		<pre class="command">Undo last change (can be repeated to undo preceding commands)</pre>
		<li>Ctrl-r</li>
		<pre class="command">Redo changes which we undone</pre>
	
	</ul>
	<h3>Copy and Paste commands</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>yy</li>
		<pre class="command">Copies the current line</pre>
		<li>p</li>
		<pre class="command">Puts the copied text after the cursor</pre>

	<h3>String Search</h3>
	<p align=left>When you start these commands, the command just typed will be shown on the last line of the screen, where you type the particular string to look for</p>
	<ul style="list-style-type:none;">
		<li><strong>/</strong></li>
		<pre class="command">Searches forward (downwards) in the file</pre>
		<li><strong>?</strong><li>
		<pre class="command">Searches backwards (upwards) in the file</pre>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>How to exit vi (must be in command mode)</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>:q</li>
		<pre class="command">Command to quit</pre>
		<li>:q!</li>
		<pre class="command">Command to quit without saving</pre>
		<li>:w</li>
		<pre class="command">Command to save contents</pre>
		<li>:wq</li>
		<pre class="command">Command that combines saving and quitting</pre>
	</ul>
