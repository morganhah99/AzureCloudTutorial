	<h2>Docker Tutorial</h2>
	<h3>Introduction:</h3>
	<p>Docker is an open source containerization platform. Containerization is defined as a form of operating<br>
	system virtualization, through which applications are run in isolate user spaces called containers, all using<br>
	the same shared operating system. It enables developers to package applications<br>
	into containers-standardized executable components combining application source code with the operating system<br>
	libraries and dependecies required to run that code in any environment. Containers simplify delivery of distributed<br>
	applications, and have become increasingly popular as organizations shift to cloud-native development and hybrid
	multicloud environments</p>

	<h3>What are containers?</h3>
	<p>The industry standard today is to use Virtual Machines (VMs) to run software applications. VMs run application inside a guest operating system,<br> 
	which runs on virtual hardward powered by the server's host OS. VMs are great at providing full process isolation for applications: there are very<br>
	ways a problem in the host operating system can affect the software running in the guest operating system, and vice-versa. Isolation<br>
	comes at a great cost. However, containers take a different approac: by leveraging the low-level mechanics of the host operating system,<br>
	containers provide most of the isolation of virtual machines at a fraction of the computing power.</p>
	<h3>What are Docker Images?</h3>
	<p>Docker images are the basis of containers and are similar to a git repository actually. Images can be committed with changes and have<br>
	multiple versions. If you don't pull a specific version number, the client defaults to the latest.</p>
	<h3>Dockerfile</h3>
	<p>A Dockerfile is a simple text file that contains a list of commands that the Docker client calls while creating an image. It's a <br>
	simple way to automate the image creation process. Commands written in a Dockerfile are almost identical to Linux commands.</p>
	<h3>Typical Terminology</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Docker Daemon -The background service running on the host that manages building, running, and distributing Docker containers. The daemon is the process<br>
			runs in the operating system which clients talk to.</li><br>
		<li>Docker Client - The command line tool that allows the user to interact with the daemon. More generally, there can be other forms of clients too<br>
			such as Kitematic which provide a GUI to the users</li><br>
		<li>Docker Hub - A registry of Docker images. You can think of the registry as a directory of all available Docker images. If required, one can host<br>
		their own Docker registries and can use them for pulling images</li>
	
	</ul>
